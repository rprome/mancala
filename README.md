# Mancala
This project uses a heuristic minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to win against a bot.

Instructions:

python3 controller.py \
  --player1 "python3 random_player.py" \
  --player2 "python3 main.py" \
  --debug

Add main.py, controller.py (renamed from whatever Adam had it as), and random_player.py to the same project. Navigate in your terminal to the project and run the command above in bash.

If it doesn't recognize python, do "brew install python3" unless you're on Windows. Figure it out for PowerShell.
